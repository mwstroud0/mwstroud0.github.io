This week I wanted to learn three.js because it looks to be a very powerful library.
I took inspiration from rotating cube examples in the book and wanted to explore different materials.

The program was built up using the tutorial example for a rotating cube in three.js documentation first.

Then I explored diffuse materials (Phong Shading), Reflective metal-like materials, and refractive materials.

I made a tetrahedron, cube, and sphere rotate in a scene within a 360 scene.

I have 2 Pictures showing outputs, and these files pull libraries from a cdn, so you can just 
localhost it with choice tech. I like using VS code live server.

I was happy to see that the THREE.MeshPhysicalMaterial is affected by other geometries
in the scene as shown in the second screenshot, the cube is being refracted through the sphere.
